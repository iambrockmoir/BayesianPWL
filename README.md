#Bayesian Parameter Estimation

A Bayesian approach to fitting a piecewise linear model.  To learn these techniques I opted to program everything from scratch rather that using premade libraries.

Demonstrates the use of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Gibbs sampling

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Bayesian statistics

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Bayesian parameter estimation
